                  Simon and I have shared countless lattes, laughs and late night
                  dinners, all with a musical soundtrack guaranteed to put a smile

                  Simon's got a winning combo of skill, charm, brilliance
                  and plain ol' good luck, which makes him a great partner in
                  crime. He loves to teach and encourage all of us, and he has an
                  unwavering desire to learn, create and build. If he
                  doesn't have the answer he can quickly figure it out,
                  and he willingly lends a hand to anyone who needs it.
                  He's taught me why trying and failing is as important as succeeding,
                  and he's always been my loudest cheerleader. Can't wait to make it official. Thanks, buddy!

                  looked up she had the look of a puppy caught chewing on a fine pair of

                    purchased her first car: Peppercorn L. Wexbottom. Congrats
                    on the new addition to the family!

                  <p class="flex-caption">
                    Anna is a world traveler who has lived in Vancouver, Barcelona,
                    Cologne, London, ON, and Vancouver - and that's just in the last
                    five years! Simon's older sister, a part of Anna's heart lives in
                    South Africa where she spent a lot of time as a kid.

                  <p>
                    Anna is an architect with a great eye for style, design and
                    organization, making her super helpful for throwing a wedding
                    (and for life in general) - she's more organized about the
                    wedding than we are! She and her partner Mike Martin live in the
                    Gastown area of Vancouver and have a view of the North Shore
                    that can make a grown man weep.

                  <p class="flex-caption">
                    Many ladies at the wedding will no doubt be wearing amazing jewelry
                    made by Kat, a Revelstoke silversmith
                    (<a href="http://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/katcadegan">check out some
                    of her wares on Etsy!</a>). Kat and her Mexican pooch SeÃ±or are
                    the cutest couple in town. Kat will be coming off a summer as a
                    treeplanting foreman, so she'll likely be the most tanned, toned
                    and ready to party.

                  <p>
                    Kitty is an exceptional baker, an incredibly generous friend,
                    and a dose of welcome comic relief in all our lives. Revelstoke
                    is lucky to have her, and we're lucky to have her as a bridesmaid!

                    From close friend to closer next-door-neighbour, Red eats
                    as many meals at Simon and KK's house as at her own, and
                    comes over for many coffees a week. If she's not at theirs
                    they are at hers - there is talk of digging a tunnel, or at
                    least stringing up tin can telephones.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Red helps all her friends stay happy, healthy and well-fed,
                    and her enthusiasm is infectious. Red has been in Revelstoke
                    for six years and is kind of a big deal. An party-planning
                    extraordinaire, she organizes Revesltoke's best events and
                    good times!

                    Karilyn and Andrea met during their English masters degrees
                    at Simon Fraser University. They provided an invaluable
                    support system to each other bolstered by plenty of wine.
                    Together they made it through grad school and became life-long
                    best buds. They tried downhill mountain biking for the first
                    time together in Whistler and surprisingly no one needed stitches.

                    Hailing from Saskatchewan, Andrea lives in Vancouver with
                    her husband Ben - they got married May 3 in Hawaii (congrats!).

                    of mischief and distrust of anyone over the age of 16.
                    Together, we have shared some of my most memorable, least
                    sharable experiences. &mdash; Luckily most before the advent
                    of facebook.

                    I first met Joe when we moved onto the same street in
                    Revelstoke in 2008. In my quest to become proficient in
                    the mountains, Joe has always been a gracious, patient
                    and encouraging mentor. Now that we've moved back to
                    Moss Street, Joe is within tin-can-and-string range.

                    anniversary in February and are a testament to love and good
                    humour. Their friendship has only gotten stronger over the
                    years, especially now that they are both retired. While we'll
                    always be their kids, we're now their friends as well. Though we
                    don't live in the same city - or even the same province - we
                    talk frequently and share laughs, triumphs and challenges.
                    They inspired Karilyn's love of skiing, cooking, gardening
                    and roller coasters. Thank you!

                    Kathryn's positive spirit and good humour as she has faced

                    impressive and inspiring. She's the epitome of grace and
                    resilience, and Ralph is full of patience, love and support.
