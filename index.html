                  dinners, all with a soundtrack guaranteed to put a smile

                  Simon has a winning combination of skill, charm, brilliance
                  and plain ol' good luck - it makes him a great partner in
                  crime! He's got an unwavering desire to learn, create and
                  build, and he loves to teach and encourage others. If he
                  doesn't have the answer he can quickly figure it out,
                  and he willingly lends a hand to anyone who needs it.
                  He's taught me the importance of not being afraid to fail,
                  and he's always been my loudest cheerleader. Thanks, buddy!

                  On our first date, I looked across the table to see Karilyn
                  finding her way to the bottom of my favourite Vancouver meal.
                  A tsunami of phá»Ÿ had already enveloped the teapot and when she
                  looked up she had the look of a puppy caught chewing on a fine pair of
                  Italian shoes. Instead of shoelaces, sprouts and vermicelli.

                <p>
                  Karilyn's unabashed ability to enjoy the moment and project sunshine has
                  helped me grow into the man I am today. I'm excited to share the rest
                  of my life with my best friend and share that promise with you all in
                  August.

              Feel like partying all night for Wexfest? Bring a tent and stay right
              on the property with us. There's lots of flat space for setting up
              camp. Once you commit to skipping the shuttle, you're there for the night,
              so bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper. Really though, you're better off
              keeping on dancing!

                for those who need. There's washrooms, a kitchen and running water,
                so don't worry about it being too rustic. We just want to give

                transportation back into Revelstoke.

                    Mike and Karilyn were office-mates at Okanagan College
                    and hit it off so well they decided to be roommates as well.
                    Mike is an informed, opinionated guy; he's who we both
                    have some of our most engaging, thoughtful conversations
                    with - everything from politics to mountain bikes, economics
                    to music.

                  <p>
                    Mike was their roommate through the brain-storming
                    and inception of his food truck business "The Taco Club,"
                    so they have also spent many nights in the hot tub discussing the

                    in costume) and she's another sister to him. Krystin moved
                    from Vancouver to Vernon this spring, and we love being
                    closer to her. Krystin spent a few months living in Revelstoke
                    and fell in love with the town (and vice versa), and she's
                    managed to get her money's worth out of a season's pass to
                    Revelstoke Mountain Resort every year since. She's been Karilyn's
                    number one helper for many massive holiday meals in Revelstoke,
                    and a good friend.

                    of her four years at a remote BC sportfishing lodge. She'll
                    out-fish you, beat you on the golf course, get your truck un-stuck
                    for you, and then drink you under the table. Don't be fooled
                    by the diminutive stature - Bear Claw charges hard.

                  <p>She and Karilyn met a few years ago and have been
                    pretty much inseperable ever since as biking, skiing and

                    also a bridesmaid. These ladies spend a LOT of girl time together!

                    Simon's younger sister Sarah was the first Wex to be born in
                    Canada (but made in South Africa). She can make Simon
                    laugh harder than anyone, and does it often. Sarah spent a
                    fun year living in Revelstoke several seasons back and we all
                    had a blast spending time skiing together.

                    Sarah lives in Vancouver. An avid cyclist, she recently

                    five years! Simon's older sister, a part of Anna's heart lives in

                    Anna is an architect with a great eye for style, design and
                    organization, making her super helpful for throwing a wedding
                    (and for life in general) - she's more organized about the
                    wedding than we are! She and her partner Mike Martin live in the
                    Gastown area of Vancouver and have a view of the North Shore
                    that can make a grown man weep.

                    the cutest couple in town. Kat will be coming off a summer as a
                    treeplanting foreman, so she'll likely be the most tanned, toned
                    and ready to party.

                    Kitty is an exceptional baker, an incredibly generous friend,

                    From close friend to closer next-door-neighbour, Red eats
                    as many meals at Simon and KK's house as at her own, and
                    comes over for many coffees a week. If she's not at theirs
                    they are at hers - there is talk of digging a tunnel, or at
                    least stringing up tin can telephones.

                    Red helps all her friends stay happy, healthy and well-fed,

                    at Simon Fraser University. They provided an invaluable
                    support system to each other bolstered by plenty of wine.
                    Together they made it through grad school and became life-long
                    best buds. They tried downhill mountain biking for the first
                    time together in Whistler and surprisingly no one needed stitches.

                    Ralph and Kathryn Kempton just celebrated their 35th wedding
                    anniversary in February and are a testament to love and good
                    humour. Their friendship has only gotten stronger over the
                    years, especially now that they are both retired. While we'll
                    always be their kids, we're now their friends as well. Though we
                    don't live in the same city - or even the same province - we
                    talk frequently and share laughs, triumphs and challenges.
                    They inspired Karilyn's love of skiing, cooking, gardening
                    and roller coasters. Thank you!
                  </p>
                  <p class="flex-caption">
                    Kathryn's positive spirit and good humour as she has faced
                    several serious health obstacles over the past few years is
                    impressive and inspiring. She's the epitome of grace and
                    resilience, and Ralph is full of patience, love and support.
                    Give Kathryn a high five at the wedding because she is kicking
                    cancer's ass.
